These are odd times. COVID-19 has impacted so many of our lives across the entire globe. I've seen a lot of dramatic changes to my own lifestyle. I went from eating out many times per week to exclusively home-cooked meals for nearly two months now. From two hours of commuting to popping out of bed and logging on for work. From working out and playing sports at least twice a week to closed gyms and canceled sports. Even my morning ritual of watching Liverpool matches on weekends was stopped abruptly.

Like many others, I've decided to use this time to reflect and try to make lasting changes to my lifestyle. Sometimes it takes a pandemic to break stubborn habits! It's also a good time to try new things. I haven't had my own website since I was a teenager and geocities was a thing! So I decided to make this my little home on the web that I can use for blogging whenever I feel like it and experimenting with web concepts. Welcome to my humble abode!
