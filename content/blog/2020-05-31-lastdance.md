It's been over a week since I finished watching The Last Dance but my Youtube feed is still full of content about Michael Jordan and The Last Dance. It has captivated the entire world of sports. Watching the expertly edited highlight sequences playing to 90s hip hop brought back so many fond memories. But the nostalgia is only part of what makes The Last Dance so great.

I was a kid in elementary school when I first started watching Michael Jordan's Bulls play. I was fortunate to live in a condominium complex that had a cable package that included WGN. I watched the games at night and mimicked Jordan buzzer beaters with a tennis ball and a cubby hole in my couch. I had no idea about the hard work and determination it takes to reach the level of greatness that MJ did but I appreciated and admired what was on display nonetheless. Watching him play and hearing his story as an adult, I can draw so much more inspiration from it.

The greatest takeaway for me is how he evolved over his career. Early in his career, he was just miles above everyone else in terms of physical ability. He would jump earlier than defenders, contort his body in mid air, wait for them to come down and still make the bucket. It must have been so demoralizing for the top defenders in the league at the time. But after his return from baseball for the '95 season he didn't have the same body. He had a completely different training regimen for baseball and he was in his early 30's. He worked tremendously hard to get back to his best and learned to assert his dominance in different ways. He changed his game, he went from high-flying athletic prowess to more calculated, efficient play.

His ability to evolve and remain the greatest was most inspiring to me. I'm a software engineer by profession and it's a profession where, similar to athletics, value often diminishes with age. My main takeaway from The Last Dance is to be more mindful in my approach and to continue to evolve and make adjustments to ensure that I not only remain competitive but continue to excel and strive for excellence.
